** Hilt can provide dependencies to other Android classes that have the @AndroidEntryPoint annotation:
    Application	                                ApplicationComponent	            @Singleton
    View Model	                                ActivityRetainedComponent	        @ActivityRetainedScope
    Activity	                                ActivityComponent	                @ActivityScoped
    Fragment                                    FragmentComponent	                @FragmentScoped
    View	                                    ViewComponent	                    @ViewScoped
    View annotated with @WithFragmentBindings	ViewWithFragmentComponent	        @ViewScoped
    Service	                                    ServiceComponent	                @ServiceScoped

    Not : The anything that is activity retained scope cannot be injected into something that singleton scope. Anything
    that's activity scoped cannot be injected into activity retained scope.

** That's one of the reason prefer Dagger/Hilt to KOIN : Dagger will check things at compile time. Not runtime.
